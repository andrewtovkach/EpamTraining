Over the past few years, one of the most important shifts in the digital world has been the move from the wide-open Web to semiclosed platforms
that use the Internet for transport but not the browser for display. It's driven primarily by the rise of the iPhone model of mobile computing,
and it's a world Google can't crawl, one where HTML doesn't rule. And it's the world that consumers are increasingly choosing, not because 
they're rejecting the idea of the Web but because these dedicated platforms often just work better or fit better into their lives. The fact 
that it's easier for companies to make money on these platforms only cements the trend. Producers and consumers agree: The Web is not the 
culmination of the digital revolution.
A decade ago, the ascent of the Web browser as the center of the computing world appeared inevitable. It seemed just a matter of time before the 
Web replaced PC application software and reduced operating systems to a poorly debugged set of device drivers, as Netscape cofounder Marc 
Andreessen famously said. First Java, then Flash, then Ajax, then HTML5 — increasingly interactive online code — promised to put all apps in the
cloud and replace the desktop with the WebTop. Open, free, and out of control.
But there has always been an alternative path, one that saw the Web as a worthy tool but not the whole toolkit. The argument then was that push
technologies such as PointCast and Microsoft's Active Desktop would create a radical future of media beyond the Web. The point was altogether 
prescient: a glimpse of the machine-to-machine future that would be less about browsing and more about getting. As it happened, PointCast 
quickly imploded, taking push with it. But just as Web 2.0 is simply Web 1.0 that works, the idea has come around again. Those push concepts
have now reappeared as APIs, apps, and the Smartphone. And this time we have Apple and the iPhone/iPad juggernaut leading the way, with tens
of millions of consumers already voting with their wallets for an app-led experience. This post-Web future now looks a lot more convincing.
Indeed, it's already here.
The Web is, after all, just one of many applications that exist on the Internet, which uses the IP and TCP protocols to move packets around. 
This architecture — not the specific applications built on top of it — is the revolution. Today the content you see in your browser — largely 
HTML data delivered via the http protocol on port 80 — accounts for less than a quarter of the traffic on the Internet and it's shrinking. 
The applications that account for more of the Internet's traffic include peer-to-peer file transfers, email, company VPNs, the machine-to-machine
communications of APIs, Skype calls, and online games, Xbox Live, iTunes, voice-over-IP phones, iChat, and Netflix movie streaming. Many of the
newer Net applications are closed, often proprietary, networks.
And the shift is only accelerating. Within five years, Morgan Stanley projects, the number of users accessing the Net from mobile devices will
surpass the number who access it from PCs. Because the screens are smaller, such mobile traffic tends to be driven by specialty software, 
mostly apps, designed for a single purpose. For the sake of the optimized experience on mobile devices, users forgo the general-purpose browser.
They use the Net, but not the Web. Fast beats flexible.
This was all inevitable. It is the cycle of capitalism. The story of industrial revolutions, after all, is a story of battles over control. A 
technology is invented, it spreads, a thousand flowers bloom, and then someone finds a way to own it, locking out others. It happens every time.
